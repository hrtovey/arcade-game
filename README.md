Frogger-Style Arcade Game
===============================

A basic arcade game with basic controls. A work in progress based on the final project from Udacity's Object-Oriented JavaScript course.

Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move your character and make it to the other side. Watch out for those lady bugs!
